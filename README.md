# Personal-Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio website created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes sections like Home, About, Skills, Projects, and Contact to showcase my profile, technical abilities, and work. I designed the layout, styled it for different devices, and added simple JavaScript features. After testing it on various browsers. This project helped me strengthen my front-end development skills and serves as an online platform to present myself professionally.
